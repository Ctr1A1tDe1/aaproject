# Alien Invasion ðŸš€ðŸ‘¾

Alien Invasion is a classic arcade-style game written in Python using the **Pygame** library. 
This project is inspired by the *Alien Invasion* game example in Eric Matthes' book, *Python Crash Course*. 
The game challenges players to defend their spaceship by shooting down waves of alien invaders.

## Features

- **Spaceship Movement**: Move your ship left or right to dodge aliens and align your shots.
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Fire bullets to destroy incoming alien ships.
- **Alien Waves**: Each level introduces new waves of aliens with increasing difficulty.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score and aim for the high score.
- **Game Over State**: The game ends when aliens reach your ship or you lose all lives.
- **High score save**: The game now saves high score on exit.

## Gameplay

The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen. 
Aliens descend from the top, moving left and right. 
Your goal is to shoot the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. 
Each alien destroyed earns you points, and advancing levels brings faster and more challenging enemies.
